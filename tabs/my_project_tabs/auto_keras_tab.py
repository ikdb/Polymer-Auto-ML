       In this tutorial, we will explore the use of AutoKeras for tabular data prediction, focusing on its automated machine learning (AutoML) capabilities. AutoKeras, part of the Keras ecosystem, offers a user-friendly and flexible approach to model building and optimization, catering to both novices and seasoned data scientists.

       AutoKeras streamlines the model development process through automated architecture search and hyperparameter tuning, enabling the rapid development of efficient and effective machine learning models. Its integration with TensorFlow ensures scalable and robust model training and deployment.
